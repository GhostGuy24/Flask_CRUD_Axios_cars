# Flask CRUD Application

## Description
This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Flask. The application allows users to manage a list of products (shoes, in this case) by performing the following operations:
- **Create**: Add new products to the list.
- **Read**: View the list of all products.
- **Update**: Edit the details of a product.
- **Delete**: Remove a product from the list.

The application has a simple front-end created using HTML and CSS, and dynamic content is rendered using Jinja templating. The back-end is powered by Flask, which handles routing and serves as the API for CRUD operations.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Python web framework for building the back-end.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the structure and styling of the website.
- **JavaScript/axios**: For handling asynchronous requests (CRUD operations) on the front-end.
- **Jinja Templating**: For dynamic rendering of content in HTML pages.
- **Python**: Used for backend logic and data manipulation.

## Features
- **Home Page**: Displays a list of available products with options to delete and update.
- **Add Product Page**: Allows users to add new products to the list.
- **Delete Product**: Remove products from the list.
- **Update Product**: Modify the details (price or description) of a product.
